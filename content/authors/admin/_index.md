I am currently a PhD student in the Leaf Lab at the University of Southern Mississippi's 
Gulf Coast Research Laboratory. My work focuses on using and developing statistical models 
to simulate and evaluate the dynamics of fish populations in the Gulf of Mexico. I have worked on 
several species, including blue crab, Vermilion Snapper, and Red Snapper. I am interested in using 
management strategy evaluation techniques to investigate the combined effects of ecological and anthropogenic pressures on commercially 
important species. Specifically, my dissertation research uses MSE to investigate how Vermilion Snapper populations respond to different 
harvest strategies while accounting for interspecific competition with Red Snapper.  
In addition to my academic research, I am interested in creating tools for communicating data and results with stakeholders and the general public. 
I have used tools and applications such as dashboards, RMarkdown files, and Shiny apps and am interested in helping others with this. I 
believe that these tools (and others) are the next step in making science more transparent, available, and approachable.
